### Why i decided to create this app?

I was following a coursera lesson (learning how to learn)) and pomodoro technique suggested for productivity. I was not sure if i should create a pomodoro app or a pomodoro timer. I challange my self to create a pomodoro app that I would like to use.

So that I would practise programming and have an good application.

### What is pomodoro technique?

Pomodoro technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodori, traditionally one per four to five, and the breaks are traditionally either short, 3 minutes or longer.

You should reward yourself after pomodoro session. Simple small rewards are ideal. That is why it would be good to have fortune wheel that would give you a random rewards you defined.

### Pomodoro helps you to:

Pomodoro is useful because it helps you to prevent procrastination.
Other benefits of pomodoro are that it helps you to get back to work. You can focus on your work and not on other things.


### You need to pay attention when you use pomodoro technique:

First sessions pick something that is hard to do. Focus first 4 sessions. 
You will be surprised how easy it is to do. It is a trick to get a good result.

2- Start the timer.

3- When the timer is done, take a break.

4- Reward your self with simple small reward.

5- Repeat steps 1-4.
