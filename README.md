> This is a Nuxt.js Fully Static website, so you can use/host it anywhere!

After almost a year that I have published my website's source code on GitHub, I've been working on a new and better version. All I had to do was learn Tailwind CSS, Nuxt.js, and Vue.js better. It's been a long journey since I pushed myself into the Tailwind CSS world, but it was amazing! It doesn't give you any components; it asks you to create your ones! And that is the most important thing to improve yourself in my opinion. It's been a great learning experience for me, and I think I've learned and improved myself a lot.

It is my website that I use daily, so I had to include everything that I needed. You'll see some pages that may not be suitable for you, but this is a real-world app, and I need them 😅

### ✨ What is included?

Website features many custom built systems, integrations and pages!

- ✅ Sections for a freelancer!
  - Projects, experiences, skills, GitHub repositories, and social media accounts.
- ✅ Static blog!
  - Completely static, no API needed, Nuxt.js Content blog ready to go!
- ✅ Firebase integration!
  - My "Daily Song" page fetches data from Firebase to display the today's song! It's all statically generated on client!
- ✅ Real-time Discord profile data using [Lanyard API](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard/)!
  - You can see what you're editing, watching or listening on your website.
- ✅ Designed with Windi CSS!
  - Windi introduces a JIT engine, a fast Tailwind compiler and many more stuff like variant grouping etc.!
  - Clean, beautiful, fast, and responsive UI!
  - No CSS used! The website is done without touching CSS (except some transitions and directives)
- ✅ Written in TypeScript, so you know what you're doing!
  - Intellisense, module prop auto-completion and all that juicy TS craziness!
- ✅ Uses Vite (`nuxt-vite`)!
  - So you don't have to worry about your CPU, build time or HMR even if we have TypeScript and lots of stuff in this project! It's just fast!
- ✅ Over 15+ custom components!
  - Smart components.
  - Custom props, styles, and classes!

### 🔧 Getting Started

If you are interested in downloading the code, compiling it and running it, you need some tools!

First of all, all of the systems require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to work, so you'll have to download it and install it on your device. This program comes with a package manager called `NPM` where you'll use to download all the dependencies of this project, including (but not limited to) Nuxt.js, Vue.js and Tailwind CSS.

If you aren't already using `yarn`, I recommend yarn because it is faster and runs better on most machines. You can install yarn globally to your system using `npm install yarn -g` command. Then you'll have access to `yarn` on your terminal (you might need to restart it).

- Download the source as a ZIP folder or clone it via `git` using the `git clone` command.
- Install dependencies with your preffered package manager.
  - With yarn: `yarn`
  - With NPM: `npm install`
- If you are going to use Firebase, you'll need to rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the config.
  - **P.S.** You don't need Firebase in this project except for the Daily page. If you are not going to create one for your own, or use Firebase for other purposes, you'll have to do this step. Otherwise you can just remove the file, delete the parts where it is imported and used, then you'll be ready to go.
- Now you can start the app using one of these commands.
  - For development:
    - With yarn: `yarn dev`
    - With NPM: `npm run dev`
  - To build and compile:
    - With yarn: `yarn generate` (or `yarn build`)
    - With NPM: `npm run generate` or (`npm run build`)

If you are wondering about **how to host it on free/paid static hosting services** like (Netlify, Vercel etc.), you can refer to [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/deployment/netlify-deployment). My project is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

### 🤔 Don't need Firebase?

If you're here just to fork the website and use it, I bet you will probably _never_ need a Firebase integration and you should definitely remove Firebase from the project if that's the case. Here's how you can do it properly:

1. Remove `firebase` and `@nuxtjs/firebase` modules, they're HUGE! You'll save lots of space when you remove them.
2. Remove `@nuxtjs/firebase` from `tsconfig.json`.
3. Remove `firebase` import and the line of `@nuxtjs/firebase` reference in the array in `config/modules.ts` file.
4. Remove `@/plugins/Firebase` reference from the plugins array in `config/plugins.ts` (remove the whole object), and delete that file from `plugins` directory, you don't need it anymore.
5. Delete `config/modules/firebase.ts`.
6. Delete the Daily page: `src/pages/daily.vue`.
   - After deleting this page, you should also remove every link to that page, there are links around the website, like in Navbar and some blog posts. You have to remove all references or you can't generate the website and it'll throw "route not found" error.

That's all you have to do if you're not going to need Firebase integration! Don't hesitate to create an issue if you run into any problems!

### ❓ What has changed?

> In (package.json) version 4.0.0, I've worked on each page and component to make them compatible with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which is an upcoming and blazing fast tool for Nuxt! You'll feel the difference!

> In (package.json) version 3.0.0, I moved and rewrote everything in TypeScript. Now it's using TypeScript for more powerful stuff!

> In (package.json) version 2.6.0, I've moved from Tailwind to WindiCSS for its features, gold-class support for Vue/Nuxt. Everything is same, but there are more stuff (like variant grouping, important prefix etc.)!

If you are wondering what has changed and what are the differences from the old version; I can only say: "EVERYTHING!"

You can take a look at [old.eggsy.xyz](https://old.eggsy.xyz) and compare it yourself 😂 You can already say UI is a lot nicer and there are some additional pages in this new one! But I also had to remove some features, including my whole API for "Overlay Creator" (it's still available under the `old.eggsy.xyz` domain but you won't be able to access it anymore from the main domain).

### 🙏 Thanks

[WindiCSS](https://github.com/windicss/windicss) - [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss)

This project wouldn't be possible if Nuxt.js team wouldn't have created such an amazing framework, and of course Vue.js is the king 👑. Thank you all contributors that made this projec even better! Tailwind CSS is a really good CSS utility framework that helped me a lot and I can't get myself out of it anymore! Last but not least, I'd like to thank to the module authors, they're all amazing and I appreciate your work!
